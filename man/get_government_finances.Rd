\details{
Data are from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Survey of State and Local
Government Finances and Census of Governments, compiled per: Pierson K., Hand M.,
and Thompson F. (2015). The Government Finance Database: A Common Resource for
Quantitative Research in Public Financial Analysis. PLoS ONE doi:
10.1371/journal.pone.0130119. See \url{https://my.willamette.edu/site/mba/public-datasets}.

This is a survey in most years--i.e., only a subset of the full population of governments
comprises the sampling frame--but is a true census with relatively high response rates (90\%\%+)
in years ending in 2 and 7.
