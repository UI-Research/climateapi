}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{A character vector of URLs of length one or greater.}

\item{directory}{The path to a single directory--not to a file--where the .xlsx file(s) will be saved.}

\item{file_names}{Optionally, a character vector of the same length as \code{urls} containing only the file names (not the full paths) with which the downloaded files should be named. If NULL (default), file names are extracted from \code{urls}.}

\item{silent}{If TRUE (default), files are saved silently. If FALSE, downloaded files are read and returned as a list.}
}
\value{
When \code{silent = TRUE} (default): Returns NULL invisibly. Files are downloaded and saved to \code{directory}.
When \code{silent = FALSE}: Returns a list of data frames, one per URL, containing the contents of each downloaded .xlsx file as read by \code{openxlsx::read.xlsx()}. List elements are in the same order as the input \code{urls}.
