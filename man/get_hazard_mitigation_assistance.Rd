\usage{
get_hazard_mitigation_assistance(
  file_path_old_grant_system = file.path(get_box_path(), "hazards", "fema",
    "hazard-mitigation-assistance", "raw",
    "HazardMitigationAssistanceProjects_2025_09_27.parquet"),

}
\arguments{
\item{file_path_old_grant_system}{The file path to raw data for HMA applications from
the older grant-reporting system. These data are typically available from:
\url{https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/hazard-mitigation-assistance-projects-v4}}

\item{file_path_new_grant_system}{The file path to raw data for HMA applications from
the newer (FEMA GO) grant-reporting system. These data are typically available from:
\url{https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/hma-subapplications-v2}}

\item{state_abbreviations}{NULL by default, in which case data are returned for all 51
states. Provide a vector of two-character USPS state abbreviations to obtain data for
a sub-selection of states.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of project-county HMA application data. Only \code{project_cost_federal_split}
should be used for county-level aggregations. Columns include:
\describe{
\item{data_source}{"hma-projects" (legacy) or "hma-subapplications" (FEMA GO).}
\item{project_id}{Unique project identifier.}
\item{disaster_number}{FEMA disaster number (if disaster-related).}
\item{project_program_area}{HMA program: HMGP, BRIC, FMA, or PDM.}
\item{project_fiscal_year}{Fiscal year of the project.}
\item{state_name}{Full state name.}
\item{county_geoid}{Five-digit county FIPS code.}
\item{county_population}{County population used for allocation.}
\item{project_status}{Current project status (e.g., "Closed", "Active").}
\item{project_cost_federal}{Total federal cost at project level.}
\item{project_cost_federal_split}{Federal cost allocated to this county.}
}
}
\description{
Retrieves Hazard Mitigation Assistance project data from both the legacy
HMA Projects dataset and the newer FEMA GO subapplications dataset, harmonized
at the project-county level.
}
\details{
Data are from FEMA's OpenFEMA API, combining two data sources: the legacy
Hazard Mitigation Assistance Projects (v4) and the newer HMA Subapplications (v2).
Multi-county projects are split across counties based on population proportions.
