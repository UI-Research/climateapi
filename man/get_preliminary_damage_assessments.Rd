\title{Get Data from Preliminary Damage Assessments Submitted to FEMA for Disaster Declarations}
\usage{
get_preliminary_damage_assessments(
  file_path = file.path(get_box_path(), "hazards", "urban",
    "preliminary-damage-assessments", "pda_data.csv"),
  directory_path = file.path(get_box_path(), "hazards", "urban",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The file path to the cached dataset, or if there is no cache, the path at which to cache the resulting data.}

\item{directory_path}{The path to the directory where PDA PDFs are stored. Use \code{scrape_pda_pdfs} to generate these files.}

\item{use_cache}{Boolean. Read the existing dataset stored at \code{file_path}? If FALSE, data will be generated anew. Else, if a file exists at \code{file_path}, this file will be returned.}
}
\value{

\item{pa_per_capita_impact_statewide, pa_per_capita_impact_countywide_max, pa_per_capita_impact_countywide_min}{Numeric. Per capita impact metrics.}
\item{pa_per_capita_impact_indicator_statewide, pa_per_capita_impact_indicator_countywide}{Character. Per capita impact indicator values.}
\item{text}{Character. Full extracted text from the PDA for reference.}

\description{
These data reflect extracted attributes from PDF preliminary damage assessments
hosted on FEMA's website at: https://www.fema.gov/disaster/how-declared/preliminary-damage-assessments/reports.
Owing to the unstructured nature of the source documents, some fields may be incorrect
in the data returned by the function, though significant quality checks have been
implemented in an effort to produce a high-quality dataset.
