Data are extracted from PDF reports hosted at
\url{https://www.fema.gov/disaster/how-declared/preliminary-damage-assessments/reports}.
Owing to the unstructured nature of the source documents, some fields may be incorrect
in the data returned by the function, though significant quality checks have been
implemented in an effort to produce a high-quality dataset.
