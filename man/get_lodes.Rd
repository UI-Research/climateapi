\title{Get LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data
Returned data are from LODES Version 8, which is enumerated in 2020-vintage geometries.}
\usage{
get_lodes(
  lodes_type,
  jobs_type = "all",
  states,
  years,
  geography = "tract",
  state_part = "main"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lodes_type}{One of c("rac", "wac", "od"). "rac" = Residence Area Characteristics, where jobs are associated with employees' residences. "wac" = Workplace Area Characteristics, where jobs are associated with employees' workplaces. "od" = Origin-Destination data, where jobs are associated with both workers' residences and their workplaces.}

\item{jobs_type}{One of c("all", "primary"). Default is "all", which includes multiple jobs for workers with multiple jobs. "primary" includes only the highest-paying job per worker.}

\item{states}{A vector of state abbreviations.}

\item{years}{A vector of years.}

\item{geography}{One of c("block", "block group", "tract", "county", "state"). Default is "tract".}

\item{state_part}{One of c("main", "aux"). Default is "main", which includes only workers who reside inside the state where they work. "aux" returns only workers who work in the specified state but live outside of that state.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one record per geography per year per job type. Attributes include total jobs and jobs by worker earnings, industry, and demographics; the origin-destination results have more limited demographics compared to the "wac" and "rac" results.
