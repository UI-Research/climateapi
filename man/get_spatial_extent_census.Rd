\title{Get the Census geographies that overlap with the input spatial dataset}
\usage{
get_spatial_extent_census(data, return_geometry = FALSE, projection = 5070)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An sf-formatted dataframe}

\item{return_geometry}{Logical. Include the geometries of returned geographies?}

\item{projection}{The EPSG code of the desired projection. Default is 5070 (Albers Equal Area).}
}
\value{
A tibble (or \code{sf} object if \code{return_geometry = TRUE}) containing Census geographies that overlap with the input spatial data. The structure depends on the geographic extent:
\describe{
\item{When multiple states overlap}{Returns state-level data with columns: \code{state_geoid} (2-digit FIPS), \code{geography} ("state").}
\item{When a single state overlaps}{Returns tract-level data with columns: \code{state_geoid} (2-digit FIPS), \code{county_geoid} (5-digit FIPS), \code{geography} ("tract").}
}
If \code{return_geometry = TRUE}, the geometry column is retained; otherwise it is dropped.
