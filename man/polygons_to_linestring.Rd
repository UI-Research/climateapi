\title{Convert polygons into their component linestrings}
\usage{
polygons_to_linestring(.sf)
}
\arguments{
\item{.sf}{The spatial dataframe containing one or more polygons}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object (simple feature collection) with geometry type LINESTRING. The returned object contains:
\describe{
\item{polygon_id}{Integer. The row index of the originating polygon from the input \code{.sf} object, enabling linkage back to the source polygon.}
\item{line_id}{Integer. A sequential identifier for each line segment within its originating polygon. Line segments are ordered according to the vertex sequence of the polygon boundary.}
\item{...}{All original attributes from the input \code{.sf} object are preserved and joined back via \code{polygon_id}.}
\item{geometry}{LINESTRING geometry. Each line segment represents one edge of the original polygon boundary.}
}
The CRS of the output matches the input \code{.sf} object (transformed to EPSG:5070 during processing).
