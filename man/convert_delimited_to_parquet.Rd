\usage{
convert_delimited_to_parquet(
  inpath,
  outpath = NULL,
  delimit_character = ",",
  subsetted_columns = NULL,
  dataset = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inpath}{The local path to read CSV data from.}

\item{outpath}{The local path to write parquet data to.}

\item{delimit_character}{The delimiting character of the raw data.}

\item{subsetted_columns}{The columns to include in the outputted parquet data.}

\item{dataset}{NULL by default. Alternately, one of c("nfip_policies", "ihp_registrations"). If not null, this will be used to select the columns that are returned.}
}
\value{
NULL (invisibly). This function is called for its side effect of writing a parquet file to disk at the specified \code{outpath} (or a path derived from \code{inpath} with a .parquet extension). The function reads the input file in chunks to handle large files efficiently, optionally subsets to specified columns, and writes the result in Apache Parquet format using \code{arrow::write_parquet()}.
