    warning("
FEMA does not provide consistent county-level identifiers such as GEOIDs. As such, some 'counties'--in particular,
independent cities and tribal lands, but also other non-county, sub-state geographies--have missing GEOIDs but valid
records of IHP registrations. Users have multiple options for summarizing data at various geographies:

(1) Use relatively non-missing fields included in the raw data by FEMA, including state and zip code.
(2) Use fields with moderate missingness, such as `substate_geography`, which is often (but not always) the county.
(3) Crosswalk zip codes to counties using the `zip_county_xwalk` data frame, which is the second item in the list returned by this function.
    This will produce consistent, standardized county-level results, though statistics at this geography will be estimates of county-level figures
    based on areal interpolation. Analysts will need to use the `afact` variable to calculate these estimates, akin to:
